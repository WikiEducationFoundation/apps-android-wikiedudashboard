## Android App Setup

Before you begin, you should have already downloaded the Android Studio SDK and set it up correctly. You can find a guide on how to do this here: [Setting up Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio).

## Building the Code

1. Fork and Clone the repository using HTTP: git clone https://github.com/yourname/apps-android-wikiedudashboard.git

2. Open Android Studio.

3. Click on 'Open an existing Android Studio project'

4. Browse to the directory where you cloned the repository and click OK.

5. Let Android Studio import the project.

6. Build the application in your device by clicking run button.
(Android Studio installs your app on your connected device and starts it)
